It conforms the\n * <a target=\"_blank\" rel=”noopener” href=\"https://github.com/umdjs/umd\">UMD standard</a>.\n * In case you use ES6 imports all you need is: <br/>`import tt from 'services.min.js'`\n * - __services-node.min.js__ - use this file if you want to use our services in Node.js.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info margin-top-16\">\n * If you want to display a map on the webpage, go to\n * {{#crossLinkModule \"Maps\"}}Maps library documentation{{/crossLinkModule}}.\n*  </div>\n * @module Services\n * @main Services\n */\n\n/**\n * This object aggregates all the services available in TomTom.\n *\n * Please refer to the following documentation to check what properties are on the tt object,\n * and how you can make calls to TomTom services.\n *\n * @class tt\n * @namespace Services\n */\n\n/**\n * @property services\n * @type services\n * @description An object, which contains all supported services.\n */\n\n/**\n * @method sdkInfo\n * @type function\n * @description Returns SDK details (e.g., version).\n * @return {Object}\n */\n\n/**\n * @method setProductInfo\n * @type function\n * @description This method sets the content of the TomTom-User-Agent header.
